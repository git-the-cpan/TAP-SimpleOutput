NAME

    TAP::SimpleOutput - Simple closure-driven TAP generator

VERSION

    This document describes version 0.003 of TAP::SimpleOutput - released
    May 05, 2015 as part of TAP-SimpleOutput.

SYNOPSIS

        use TAP::SimpleOutput 'counter';
    
        my ($_ok, $_nok, $_skip, $_plan) = counters();
        say $_ok->('TestClass has a metaclass');
        say $_ok->('TestClass is a Moose class');
        say $_ok->('TestClass has an attribute named bar');
        say $_ok->('TestClass has an attribute named baz');
        do {
            my ($_ok, $_nok, $_skip, $_plan) = counters(1);
            say $_ok->(q{TestClass's attribute baz does TestRole::Two});
            say $_ok->(q{TestClass's attribute baz has a reader});
            say $_ok->(q{TestClass's attribute baz option reader correct});
            say $_plan->();
        };
        say $_ok->(q{[subtest] checking TestClass's attribute baz});
        say $_ok->('TestClass has an attribute named foo');
    
        # STDOUT looks like:
        ok 1 - TestClass has a metaclass
        ok 2 - TestClass is a Moose class
        ok 3 - TestClass has an attribute named bar
        ok 4 - TestClass has an attribute named baz
            ok 1 - TestClass's attribute baz does TestRole::Two
            ok 2 - TestClass's attribute baz has a reader
            ok 3 - TestClass's attribute baz option reader correct
            1..3
        ok 5 - [subtest] checking TestClass's attribute baz
        ok 6 - TestClass has an attribute named foo

DESCRIPTION

    We provide one function, counters(), that returns a number of simple
    closures designed to help output TAP easily and correctly, with a
    minimum of fuss.

FUNCTIONS

 counters($level)

    This function returns four closures that each generate a different type
    of TAP output. It takes an optional $level that determines the
    indentation level (e.g. for subtests). These coderefs are all closed
    over the same counter variable that keeps track of how many test have
    been run so far; this allows them to always output the correct test
    number.

        my ($_ok, $_nok, $_skip, $_plan, $_todo, $_freeform) = counters();
    
        $_ok->('whee')            returns "ok 1 - whee"
        $_nok->('boo')            returns "not ok 2 - boo"
        $_skip->('baz')           returns "ok 3 # skip baz"
        $_plan->()                returns "1..3"
        $_todo->('bip', 'daleks') returns "bip # TODO daleks"
        $_freeform->('yay')       returns "yay"

    Note that calling the $_plan coderef only returns an intelligible
    response when called after all the output has been generated; this is
    analogous to using Test::More without a declared plan and
    done_testing() at the end. If you need or want to specify the plan
    prior to running tests, you'll need to do that manually.

  subtests

    When counter() is passed an integer, the generated closures all indent
    themselves appropriately to indicate to the test harness / TAP parser
    that a subtest is being run. (Namely, each statement returned is
    prefaced with $level * 4 spaces.) It's recommended that you use
    distinct lexical scopes for subtests to allow the usage of the same
    variable names (why make things difficult?) without clobbering any
    existing ones and to ensure that the subtest closures are not
    inadvertently used at an upper level.

        my ($_ok, $_nok) = counters();
        $_ok->('yay!');
        $_nok->('boo :(');
        do {
            my ($_ok, $_nok, $_skip, $_plan) = counters(1);
            $_ok->('thing 1 good');
            $_ok->('thing 2 good');
            $_ok->('thing 3 good');
            $_skip->('over there');
            $_plan->();
        };
        $_ok->('subtest passed');
    
        # returns
        ok 1 - yay!
        not ok 2 - boo :(
            ok 1 - thing 1 good
            ok 2 - thing 2 good
            ok 3 - thing 3 good
            ok 4 # skip over there
            1..4
        ok 3 - subtest passed

 counters_and_levelset($level)

    Acts as counters(), except returns an additional coderef that can be
    used to adjust the level of the counters.

    This is not something you're likely to need.

USAGE WITH Test::Builder::Tester

    This package was created from code I was using to make it easier to
    test my test packages with Test::Builder::Tester:

        test_out $_ok->('TestClass has a metaclass');
        test_out $_ok->('TestClass is a Moose class');
        test_out $_ok->('TestClass has an attribute named bar');
        test_out $_ok->('TestClass has an attribute named baz');

    Once I realized I was using the exact same code (perhaps at different
    points in time) in multiple packages, the decision to break it out
    became pretty easy to make.

SUBTESTS

    Subtest formatting can be done by passing a an integer "level"
    parameter to counter(); see the function's documentation for details.
